We know the ladder is 5 meters long, and the base is 4 meters from the wall. But how can we find the height of the wall? This is where the Pythagorean Theorem comes to our rescue! The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of squares of the other two sides."

We start with a right triangle, with sides labeled a, b, and c, where c is the hypotenuse. Now, let's construct a square on each side of the triangle. The areas of these squares reveal something remarkable. The Pythagorean Theorem states that the sum of the areas of the squares on the two legs equals the area of the square on the hypotenuse. In other words: a squared plus b squared equals c squared. This beautiful relationship holds true for every right triangle!"

We have a right triangle where the hypotenuse c equals 13 and one leg b equals 5. We need to find the other leg a. Starting with the Pythagorean theorem, we rearrange to solve for a. Subtract b squared from both sides to isolate a squared. Now substitute our known values: 13 squared minus 5 squared. That gives us 169 minus 25 equals 144. Taking the square root, we find that a equals 12."
