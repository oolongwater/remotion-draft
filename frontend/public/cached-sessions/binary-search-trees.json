The key rule is: left children are smaller than the parent, and right children are larger. So three is less than eight, and ten is greater than eight. This rule applies recursively to every subtree. Each node follows the same pattern. One is less than three, which is less than six. The same ordering rule everywhere! This recursive structure makes BSTs powerful for efficient searching and sorting."
