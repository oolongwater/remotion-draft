# modal.gpu

**GPU configuration shortcodes**

You can pass a wide range of `str` values for the `gpu` parameter of
[`@app.function`](https://modal.com/docs/reference/modal.App#function).

For instance:
- `gpu="H100"` will attach 1 H100 GPU to each container
- `gpu="L40S"` will attach 1 L40S GPU to each container
- `gpu="T4:4"` will attach 4 T4 GPUs to each container

You can see a list of Modal GPU options in the
[GPU docs](https://modal.com/docs/guide/gpu).

**Example**

```python
@app.function(gpu="A100-80GB:4")
def my_gpu_function():
    ... # This will have 4 A100-80GB with each container
```

**Deprecation notes**

An older deprecated way to configure GPU is also still supported,
but will be removed in future versions of Modal. Examples:

- `gpu=modal.gpu.H100()` will attach 1 H100 GPU to each container
- `gpu=modal.gpu.T4(count=4)` will attach 4 T4 GPUs to each container
- `gpu=modal.gpu.A100()` will attach 1 A100-40GB GPUs to each container
- `gpu=modal.gpu.A100(size="80GB")` will attach 1 A100-80GB GPUs to each container
